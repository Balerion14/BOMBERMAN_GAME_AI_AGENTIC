# BOMBERMAN\_GAME\_AI\_AGENTIC

üïπÔ∏è Bomberman AI Project



This project is a Bomberman game engine fully developed in Python.



The core game logic (grid, bombs, explosions, collisions, score system) is implemented entirely in Python.



A simple front-end interface was built with pygame, allowing agent to interact with the game.



The gameplay features multiple agents competing against each other, but unlike classic multi-agent frameworks, the interactions and decision-making are implemented directly within the custom Python game engine.



This project demonstrates:



Python game engine development from scratch



Flask integration for a lightweight front-end



Agent-based competition and autonomous behaviors in a game environment
